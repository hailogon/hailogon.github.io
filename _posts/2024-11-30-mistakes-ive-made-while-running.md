title: Mistakes I've made while running
categories: [running]
---
When I started running, I absolutely hated it. Every mile was a struggle, everything hurt afterwards, and in those first nine months the only thing that kept me going was spite. A friend had teased me when I’d wondered out loud about running a marathon “in a couple of years' time,” and in response I’d silently vowed to take up running in secret and prove him wrong.

The secret part of that pledge lasted only as long as it took me to run my first 5K, but I dutifully revealed my full hand after completing the marathon a couple of years later. Naturally, he’d completely forgotten ever doubting me. So it goes. But what started out as a project of spite had quickly become the greatest love of my 30s. Yes, I’m aware of how this sounds and I don’t care.

But this isn’t a blog about how I fell in love with running. Like any love, running hurts you and energizes you in almost equal measure. It’s energized me into wanting to head out into all kinds of weather, and then sentenced me to a week of rest whenever I’ve gotten too cocky. It's made my body feel the best it's ever felt in years, and it's caused pain that I didn't previously think was possible. So here are the big three ways I fucked up, and what I’d do differently if I were to start on this journey again.

## Mistake 1: If a training method feels bad, don’t do it

My first nine months of running went great, amazing even. I religiously followed a Couch to 5K, then a Couch to 10K plan, then a [Hal Higdon half marathon plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/) without so much as a glimpse of my body’s fragility.

Things went sideways when I embarked on a full marathon training plan with the help of a shiny new Garmin Forerunner 55, an entry level smartwatch that screams “No thanks, I’m just here for the running.” 

I don’t mean to say there’s anything wrong with the watch. The watch is great\! So great, in fact, that I’ve continued to use it to this day and have it on my wrist as I’m typing this sentence. But what threw me was that its marathon training plan was the first I’d ever encountered that asked me to run at an “Easy Pace.” I was perplexed. When all running is hard, what on earth is an “Easy Pace?”

What I should have done was to recognize that this marathon training plan was too advanced for me, and instead find a plan geared towards someone who can only operate at two speeds (running, walking, and I guess being completely stationary? So three speeds). Instead, I tried to find ways to make it work, to fit this square training plan into my circular hole (ahem). 

Maybe heart rate training zones could offer the answer? The thinking goes that you can divide your active heart rate into five rough zones, and adjust your exertion to keep it within the appropriate zone for your workout. Zone 4 is for intense, anaerobic, workouts, and Zone 2 is for easy runs. So if I could just find a running pace that kept my heartrate in Zone 2 I’d have found my “easy” pace.

In practice, running for more than five minutes quickly sent my heart rate spiking up out of Zone 2, and it seemed like no amount of slowing down would stop it. I bought a chest-mounted heart rate sensor in the hope that more accurate data would fix it, I adjusted the heart rate zone settings on my watch, and I sought out endless advice about running with better form or, like, breathing better. 

The only thing that actually worked was simply stopping running entirely and walking when my heart rate crept too high. I should have stopped to notice how weird and unintuitive this felt, but I was too focussed on making my harebrained scheme work that I didn’t.

Ultimately, this decision led to an injury that I’m still trying to kick to this day. After weeks spent run-walking, the time finally came to do a half marathon at my marathon pace. It was a complete disaster. While run-walking is a completely legitimate way to gradually build up your ability to run longer stretches, it’s a bad idea to suddenly run continuously for two hours after run-walking for weeks. By the end of the race, both of my knees were shot, and I could barely walk for the rest of the week without pain. It was months before I could run any kind of distance without everything cramping up. 

I don’t doubt that Zone 2 training works great for lots of people out there. Maybe it even works for people who have to run-walk to keep their heart rate low enough. But it didn’t work for me, and trying to force it was my single biggest running mistake.

## Mistake 2: Don’t wait for something to go wrong before strength training

This was my introduction to IT Band Syndrome where your iliotibial band (IT band) on the outside of your quad gets irritated and causes pain in your knee. In my case, my muscles didn’t have the endurance to run a half marathon with good form, my legs crumpled inwards, and my knees were left to pick up the pieces. No wonder they quit on me.

I’ve met runners who’ve somehow avoided getting injured despite never strength training and, honestly, good for them. But for me, a man who basically did no exercise until he decided to run a marathon, strength training was essential. And I wish I hadn’t waited to learn that the hard way. 

## Mistake 3: Just fucking go and see a physio

This is a bit of a weird one for me, because I’ve been to see a physio multiple times since I started running. But if I’m being completely straight with you, I wish I’d gone more, and multiple times I went I wish I’d gone earlier.

Take the aftermath of the London Marathon, where my ITBS had reemerged just one hour in to the five hour journey. After I crossed the finish line, I resolved to take as much time as I needed to sort out my ITBS once and for all. But, for whatever stupid reason, this process didn’t start with just going to see a physio. 

Instead, I hopped from internet-recommended fix to internet-recommended fix. I stopped running entirely, then I focussed exclusively on HIIT workouts, then I focused on strength, then when none of this worked I started running again but obsessed over my form. I tried raising my knees higher, kicking my heels, pumping my arms more, or less, or landing on a different part of my feet. For one ridiculous week I even ran to a metronome because I was so sure my low running cadence was to blame.

The first problem is that there are a million different potential causes of ITBS, and it’s hard to know which of them, or which *group* of them was responsible for mine at that particular moment in time. A year previous a physio told me that weak glutes were to blame, but even after months of strength training my symptoms remained.

The second problem is that any solution takes time, and it takes consistency. But in the meantime, YouTube’s algorithm has identified that you’re a guy with ITBS, and so your feed gets filled with videos yelling at you to “STOP” doing the treatment you’re currently trying, and try their specific combination of rest/stretching/strengthening/etc. I flitted from fix to fix, never truly seeing any of them through, never truly seeing any improvement. 

In my case, it seems the issue now is less weak muscles, and more muscles that have gotten too tight after I abused them for months on end. But my specific pain triggers are less important than the fact that they’re unique to me, and no amount of YouTube videos would have ever diagnosed them. So, if you’re able to, just go and see a physio. I’ve never regretted it.

## Don’t do what Jonny Don’t does

The irony has not escaped me that I’m a person on the internet telling you not to place too much stock in the advice from people on the internet. But if I had to distill what I’ve learned from my first two and a half years of running down into a simple list, it would probably go something like this: 

* Running requires strong leg muscles as well as a strong aerobic system. Don’t skimp on either. Strength train, and strength train with good form. Your body will find ways to not use muscles that it thinks aren’t up to the task at hand, and sometimes you have to fight to change that.  
* It feels shit to limit your mileage when you feel like you could run further, but it’s worth it. The 10 percent rule is your friend.   
* No one on YouTube knows what’s causing your injury, but a physio might. I have never regretted going to a physio, I have only ever regretted not going earlier.  
* If some overengineered training hack doesn’t feel right, don’t force it. It might just not be right for you right now.
